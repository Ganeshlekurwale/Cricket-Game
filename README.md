# Cricket Game 🏏

Welcome to the Cricket Game project! 🎉

## Description ℹ️

Cricket Game is a simple web-based game where users can play a virtual version of the popular bat and ball game. The game simulates the excitement of a cricket match where players can choose to bat, bowl, or aim for the stumps. The computer makes its choice randomly, and based on both choices, the game determines the winner. It's a fun way to enjoy a quick cricket match right from your browser! 🕹️

## Game Rules 📜

1. The game involves three choices: "Bat", "Ball", and "Stump". 🦇 🏏 🌲
2. You can select one of these options by clicking the respective button. 🔘
3. The computer randomly selects one of the three choices as well. 💻 🎲
4. The outcome of the game is determined based on the following rules:
   - If both the player and the computer choose the same option, the result is a tie. 🤝
   - If the player's choice beats the computer's choice, the player wins. 🎉
   - If the computer's choice beats the player's choice, the computer wins. 💻 🎉
5. After making a choice, an alert will display the player's choice, the computer's choice, and the result of the game. 🚨
